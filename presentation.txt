Hello.

We'll cut straight to the chase, maps have become a very core part of our everyday lives.
Unfortunately, they aren't good enough for our taste. Although they can help reduce the risk of getting lost, they do nothing about feeling lost. Maps are inherently cluttered, maps are confusing.

That's why we came up with Stroll. Stroll will allow you to go wherever you want without ever needing a map ever again.

Ladies and gentlemen, we're offering you the first MAPLESS turn-by-turn navigation tool.
Never again will you have to look for directions. From now on, you'll be able to feel them.

Stroll is an Android app that makes use of the Myo's haptic feedback in order to guide you through your journey.
Not only is Stroll intuitive, but it was designed to be simple and nothing more.

You simply run the app and stroll.

Let's go ahead and run through it together.
This is the pairing screen. Wow so simple.

So let's walk to McGill. (your favorite university.)
And that's it. You can put it in your pocket and walk.
The vibrations are intuitive enough to tell you the rest.

And you saw that. No map. All you would ever need to really know is your progress.
Whenever you need to take a turn, the wristband will notify you and point you in the right direction.
Not sure which way to go? Just hold out your arm and swivel. The vibration will be strongest in the right direction!

As for our market, everyone.

Thank you.
