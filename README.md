Developed between September 27-28 for WearHacks 2014 - the world's first wearable hackathon.
This Android app uses Google Maps' API and the Thalmic Myo's haptic feedback and gesture recognition in order to navigate someone to a destination without ever needing to pull out your phone or look up a map.
To use simply buy a Thalmic Myo, get and replace the Google Maps API key and compile.
But don't use.
